# Introduction

This second programming assignment will require you to write an R function is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g. in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this Programming Assignment will take advantage of the scoping rules of the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside of an R object.

## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

Write the following functions:

1. makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

### Here is a sample run using an invertible matrix A and it's inverse using solve(A)

```{r}
source("cachematrix.R")
A = matrix(c(1, 0, 5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 4, 0), 3, 3)
A
solve(A)
```

### First, make cache matrix using the A matrix above by calling our new function

```{r}
M <- makeCacheMatrix(A)
```

### Then, we call the cacheSolve(M) for the first time to run the solve(M) internally and cache the inverse of the M matrix.

```{r}
MInv <- cacheSolve(M)
M$get()
M$getInv()
```

### Finally, we will call the cacheSolve method once again to retrieve our cached inverse matrix

```{r}
MInv <- cacheSolve(M)
M$getInv()
```

### Project 2: completed!
